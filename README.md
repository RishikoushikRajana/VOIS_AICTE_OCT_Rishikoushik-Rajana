# Netflix Content Trends Analysis Project
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focused on analyzing the content catalog of Netflix using the "Netflix Dataset.csv" file [1]. The goal is to uncover content distribution trends to provide strategic recommendations.

## Project Goals (Objectives)
Analyze the distribution of Movies vs. TV Shows over the years.

Identify the most common genres and track their popularity changes.

Compare country-wise contributions to the Netflix catalog.

## Dataset
File: Netflix Dataset.csv

Size: 7,789 records, 11 columns (Title, Director, Cast, Country, Release Date, Type/Genres, etc.).

Timeframe: Content released between 2008 and 2021.

## Key Results and Findings
Content Volume: Content acquisition significantly ramped up from 2017, with Movies consistently dominating the annual volume of added titles.

Genre Focus: The top-performing genres are International Movies, Dramas, and Comedies [5]. The growth of "International Movies" and "International TV Shows" highlights Netflix's global expansion strategy.

Geographic Contribution: The United States is the largest contributor, followed by India and the United Kingdom, indicating high strategic investment in content from these markets.

## Requirements
The project is built using Python for data analysis [3].

Python: 3.6+

## Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## How to Run the Analysis
Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.

Place the Netflix Dataset.csv file in the same directory as your Jupyter Notebook.

Open and run the provided Python script (e.g., in a Jupyter Notebook) to execute the analysis and generate the tables and plots for each objective.
